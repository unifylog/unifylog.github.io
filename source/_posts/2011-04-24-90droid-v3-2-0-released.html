<p>Hello 90Droid fans, this is a huge release for us. We have included P90X Plus to the app.</p>
<p>So all you need to do isÂ update and you'll get them for FREE.</p>
<p>So if you are ready for the next level, all you need to do is select the The plus workouts, that is three new Programs: Plus Classic, Plus Lean and Plus Doubles. and new Workout Groups: Upper, Total Body, Abs Core, Interval. And since it's part of the app, you get charts, backup and all the features that make 90Droid unique.</p>
<p>To celebrate this launch we have reduced the price of the app for a limited time, so go ahead and take advantage of this opportunity.</p>
<p>Enjoy<br />
Team 90Droid</p>
