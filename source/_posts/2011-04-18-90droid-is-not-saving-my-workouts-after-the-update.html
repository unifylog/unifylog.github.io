<p>Symptom: When you hit save on a workout then hit prev to see the results, you don't see the item in the history.</p>
<p>Your workout is being saved it's just not showing in the "previous" list</p>
<p>Solution: go to Cycles and make sure that the active cycle includes today's date. The easiest way to do this is to leave the end-date empty, that will include everything from the start date on.</p>
<p>We created cycles to help you filter previous workouts without having to delete them. If you set a cycle as active but the end-date does not include today's date, the history list will not display them. All you will see is a warning.</p>
<p>Addendum: We have created a new post that can give you some other clues:Â <a title="Filtering Records" href="http://www.unifylog.com/?p=445">Filtering Records</a></p>
