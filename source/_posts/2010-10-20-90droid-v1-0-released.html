<p>We have released the first version of 90Droid, a fitness tracker for P90X.</p>
<p>As P90X grads and after trying several apps, we realized that there was a need for a fitness trackers created specifically for p90X. These are the design guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must be able to log a workout with minimum effort. Let's face it, in the middle of your workout you don't want to waste time typing.</li>
<li>You should be able to be up and running the minute you download the app. Â The app should come pre-configured with the most common options.</li>
<li>You should love it. It should make you want to workout and complete the program.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy</p>
<p>Team 90Droid</p>
