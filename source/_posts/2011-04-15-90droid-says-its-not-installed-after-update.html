<p>Some 90Droid users have reported that the only way to access the app is to go to the Android Market and launch it from there.</p>
<p>If this happens to you please do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the app (by going to the market),</li>
<li>Backup your workouts (<strong>Make sure you get a success message</strong>) If backup doesn't work for any reason stop here and send us an email</li>
<li>Uninstall the app</li>
<li>Go to the market and download it again</li>
<li>Go to Restore.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you follow this instructions you will get the app to work and you won't lose any data. The cause for this problem is a change in the licensing service for Android. UnfortunatelyÂ we don't have control over this within the App. We are sorry for this inconvenience.</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any questions or problems with this approach.</p>
<p>Team 90Droid</p>
