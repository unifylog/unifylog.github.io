<p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>We have received many emails telling us that 90Droid disappeared from the Android Market or cannot be accessed after a Froyo update.<br />
Unfortunately, we don't really have control over the delivery of the app (downloading and installing it). That is controlled by the android market. Please contact them using their support page:Â <a href="http://www.google.com/support/androidmarket/bin/request.py?contact_type=paid_am_apps">Android Market Support Page</a><br />
They are usually pretty good at resolving any issues.</p>
<p>Doing a quick google search, I found the following thread that discusses possible solutions <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Android%20Market/thread?tid=0b929effaf6c8573&amp;hl=en">http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Android%20Market/thread?tid=0b929effaf6c8573&amp;hl=en</a></p>
<p>I hope this helps, let us know of any other concerns you might have.</p>
