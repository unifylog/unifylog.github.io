<p>On this release we address a common concern amongst users: Â Backup/Restore. Here is how it works:</p>
<p>In the main screen press the "menu" key and select "Backup/Restore".</p>
<h2>Back up</h2>
<p>Click on the "Backup" button and the process starts:</p>
<p>You need to select a google account from the list (to be used to log you in)</p>
<p>Both your Workouts and Measurements are uploaded to a secure google server. Note: this will overwrite the previous backup.</p>
<h2>Restore</h2>
<p>Click on the "Restore" button and the process starts:</p>
<p>You need to select a google account from the list (to be used to log you in)</p>
<p>You will be presented with a list of devices that have had back ups using the same google account. (Useful to back up in one device and restore in another) Select one of them.</p>
<p>Both your Workouts and Measurements are downloaded from the cloud. Note: this will overwrite your local data.</p>
