<p>This version offers a way to enter previous workouts, a frequently requested feature.<a href="/assets/workout_date-180x300.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-312" title="workout_date" src="/assets/workout_date-180x300.png" alt="" width="180" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>To do that simply tap on menu &gt; Show Workout Date, this will set the date for the workout, this date will be persistent so you can enter as many as you need for the same day.</p>
<p>If the workout date is not shown, today's date will be used as usual.</p>
<p>Enjoy,</p>
<p>Team 90Droid</p>
