<p>The app requires permissions to your google account so you don't have to manually sign in whenever you want to do a back up to/restore from the cloud. Please note that all we do is ask google for a token to see if your account is valid so we can store your data securely and nobody else has access to it. We however, don't get access to your password or personal information.</p>
<p>The internet permission is also used to back up/restore from the cloud, as well as for validating the license and gathering anonymous information on the performance of the app. Rest assured that we don't share any data with third parties.</p>
