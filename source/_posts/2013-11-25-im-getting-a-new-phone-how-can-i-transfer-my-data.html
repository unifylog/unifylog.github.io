<h3>Option 1:</h3>
<div>If you have the same gmail account in both phones: Go to backup, tap on backup on the old phone, wait a few seconds and then on the new phone: go to back up and then hit the Restore button.</div>
<div></div>
<h3>Option 2:</h3>
<div>You have multiple backups in your sd card: Copy the folder named: 90Droid from the old phone to the new one. Then go to the Back up screen and tap Restore from SD.</div>
