<p>In order to change the program please do the following:</p>
<p>Go to the main screen (The one with the list of days)<br />
Then press the menu key on your phone<br />
From the menu you can select Preferences<br />
There you can select the program from the list.</p>
<p>Starting v 4.0 we added 'program manager' to the main menu, it  will show you the list of programs. Long-tap on the one you want and set as active. Hit back, you'll see the change in the days</p>
