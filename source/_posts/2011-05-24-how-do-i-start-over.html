<p>We've been getting this question since version 1. That's why we created the Cycles module, here is how it works:</p>
<p>A cycle is nothing but a range of dates for a specific program. for example: P90X Classic from January 1st to March 2nd.</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't have to cover the whole program</li>
<li>You can set the start and end dates that you want.</li>
<li>When you set a cycle as active, your records will be filtered to display only the ones within that date range.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having said that, if you want to "start over", all you need to do is create a new cycle, set the starting date as today and make it active, that will only show what you do from now on. So, Â if you want to go back and see what you did before, you can change the dates in the cycle or you can mark it as inactive in the edit screen.</p>
