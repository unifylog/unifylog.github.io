<p>From the main screen go to Programs > Menu > Download More.</p>
<p>There you'll find many exercise programs shared by the community, such as P90X2, Hybrids, and many others.</p>
<p>Please note that, P90X2 is a trademark of Beachbody, you'll need the DVDs for instruction on how to do the exercises. And we are not related to Beachbody in any way.</p>
