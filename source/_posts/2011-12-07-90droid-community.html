<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Congrats everybody that got an early copy of P90X2. We are relying on our community to collaborate and share the workouts so we can all build the schedule together. You can see the shared programs in Programs > Download Program. If you are interested in sharing part of the schedule, please use use Programs > Menu > New Program then Long Tap on the Program Name and Share. We are sure we'll complete it very soon. </p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Team 90Droid</p>
